A Spotify Dashboard in Power BI is an interactive data visualization tool that analyzes Spotify streaming data to provide insights into track performance, artist popularity, streaming counts, temporal patterns, and user behavior. It typically includes visuals like bar charts for top artists, line charts for streaming trends over time, pie charts for platform usage, and tables for top tracks.
Key components and steps to create a Spotify Dashboard in Power BI:
Obtain Spotify streaming data from datasets or API sources.
Clean and preprocess the data using Power BI's Power Query Editor.
Import the data into Power BI Desktop.
Create calculated columns or measures such as total streams, average streams, and date tables for time analysis.
Design visuals: bar charts for total playtime by artist, line charts for daily streams, pie charts for device/platform distribution, and tables for top songs.

Add slicers and filters to allow dynamic interaction (e.g., filtering by artist, date range, or genre).

Use DAX measures to enhance insights with calculations like monthly averages or trend summaries.

Arrange visuals with a clean, branded layout, sometimes using a PowerPoint background as a template.

Resources to follow for creating this dashboard include example projects on GitHub and Kaggle, YouTube tutorials for hands-on step-by-step guidance, and detailed documentations on the visualization types and DAX formulas used in Spotify dashboards.​​
